This folder contains files for a final project for Introduction to Methods to Digital Humanities (LDA-H503) course, conducted at University of Helsinki in fall 2018.

The purpose of the project was to explore the methodology in contrasting the differences between a novel and its film adaptation (or any other transmedia adaptations). For the project I am comparing Anthony Burgess’s A Clockwork Orange (1962), and Stanley Kubrick’s film adaptation of the novel of the same name (1971).

For more dettails about the project, see "projectdescription.pdf".
